# Hey, I am Nico aka MrTroble

I started coding back when I was really jung, hence this profile shows how my skill level, my general knowledge of programming and my focus has changed and improved over time. To put it in perspective I have started this profile with around 14 years of age, therfore it will containe some total garbage, as well as some of my biggest failures in coding.

Why am I doing this and why am I telling you? That is very simple: I think that errors and imperfections should be highlighted more in this performance oriented world because they are completly normal and everybody has them. So if you are just starting out with programming: `Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to make errors. Don't stop trying to make errors. Let other people criticize you`
