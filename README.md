# Hey, I am Nico aka MrTroble

I started coding back when I was really jung, hence this Profile shows how my skill levels, my general knowledge of programming and my focus have improved and changed while getting older over time. To put it in perspective I have started this Profil with around 14 years of age. Hence there will be some total garbage on this page, as well as my biggest failures in coding.

Why am I doing this and why am I telling you? That is very simple. I think that errors and imperfections should be highlighted more in this performance oriented world. So if you are just starting out with programming: **Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to make errors. Don't stop trying to make errors. Let other people criticize you**
